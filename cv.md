## Brief information about yourself

I am a beginner front-end developer, I have been in this industry for over a year now.

Previously, I was engaged in design and digital art. I chose the direction of front-end development because it is closely related to design.

Now front-end is my new professional direction and area of ​​constant development.

In addition to programming, I have a number of other hobbies - reading books, a constant desire for self-development, video games, long walks and cooking: I love to cook deliciously and please my loved ones with my dishes.
